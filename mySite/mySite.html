                <p>Nghi Nguyen is a first-year full-time student in the Multimedia Production Program, mainly focused on graphic design and photography. She has always been passionate about the arts and diverse colors, even since she was a young child. Her enthusiasm for them has translated into a love of editing and sketching with a stylus on any drawing tablet she has come across. Math and art are Nghi's favorite classes, and she used them as a springboard to apply to the Lethbridge College multimedia program.</p> 
                <br>
                <p>In 2021, she also received a degree in Architecture Animation Technology from the same institute. Her most memorable memory during kindergarten was when she came in second place in a drawing competition on the theme of the mid-autumn festival, which remains one of her most cherished memories of achievement.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Nghi was born in Vietnam and is happy for the opportunity to have grown up in both countries: Vietnam and Canada. She has been living, working, and attending school in Lethbridge ever since she immigrated to Canada. She has spent her youth in Vietnam and Canada, yet her goal is to travel around Europe, especially Greece, where she admires the architecture and culture of the Greeks. Although she has yet to add that at the start of each day, she would choose a random piece of music to brighten her day.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Nghiâ€™s first time picking up a pen to draw was when she was 5 years old. Occasionally, in her spare time, she would use Photoshop to make some photo edits, which she then shared on DeviantArt. Nghi's sense of art has always been influenced by her beloved father, ever since she noticed him sitting on the computer doing Corel. In her head, her father is always the coolest designer in the world. She is grateful for who she is right now.</p>
